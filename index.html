            <li>Use FoodCache to scan your grocery receipts or manually add food items to create an inventory
            <li>Follow FoodCache prompts for what to eat first
            <li>Update your food inventory as you eat it
            <li>Track food you wasted to improve purchasing habits
            <li>Waste less food, save more money
          </ol>
<p>The more you use FoodCache the more the app learns about your purchasing and consumption habits. FoodCache then helps you buy the right amount so that you waste less food.

  <div class="primary title stay-left serif">Our Story</div>
  <div class="cols-2">


<p>Our story began in 2020 when businesses all around the world started to shut due to the Coronavirus pandemic, a bunch of working professionals and freelancers joined hands to start a new journey together to help small-scale and upcoming businesses reap the benefits of digital marketing.

<p>At The Social Tadka, we have always believed in the importance of building a great, enduring relationship with our partners, striking a balance between profitability and a social conscience.

<p>It started with two individuals, our co-founders, understanding that our future is inextricably tied to the future of our respective clients and their businesses. We nurtured innumerable brand identities while working in two different organizations, and built a PAN India network of support to create an authentic yet quirky way to manage brands and businesses: one that is sustainable, transparent, and good for both the parties involved.

<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill, we have been working tirelessly to help businesses adapt to the digital market and find innovative solutions in how we build and operate our clients’ brand images, while making sure to keep our services financially reasonable.

<p>Stitching all these efforts together, we are dedicated to making our partners proud. As it has been from the beginning, our purpose goes far beyond profit. We believe in the pursuit of doing good.

<!-- <button class="accordion">How accurate are dates for food recommended consumption dates?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We have integrated data from Food Keeper suggested by USDA. There are gaps identified in data which we updated. We will improve dates as move forward. The most important point is that these dates are recommended dates only and consumer should always use their intuition to identify if food is still edible and safe to eat.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What does Nutrition Lost indicate in App screens?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Again this doesn't mean that food is unfit to be consumed. It simply means some of the nutrients might have been lost in produce?</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Is Receipt Parsing the only primary mechanism for FoodCache to create Inventory?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We have plans to support additional ways to add food items to your inventory. Receipt parsing is one convenient way to do so, but accuracy depends on how well user takes a photo of receipt and several other factors like any other OCR application out there.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Does FoodCache scan all food items in Grocery Receipt?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We only support scanning fresh produce at this time (Vegetables & fruits), stores that have weight information and complete name of the fresh produce printed on the receipts work well. We won't be able to detect produce if it has short names.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What are tips for identifying most fresh produce?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><li>Unfold, remove wrinkles from grocery receipts as much as possible.<li>Images should be taken with phone parallel to receipt andblur free. <li>Make sure all four edges are detected, to ensure good scan of food items.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Does FoodCache support all grocery Stores?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>FoodCache supports all grocery receipts from various stores. Weight and item detection works well with Wholefoods. We have seen better results with Trader Joe's, Safeway, Kroger, to name a few. If there is a grocery store that you shop often and would like us to support we can definitely support that. Please email us team@foodcacheapp.com</p>
