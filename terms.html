              <p style="  text-align: justify;"><span style=" vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Except if you opt-out as expressly permitted below, or except to the extent contrary to applicable law ("Excluded Disputes"), you hereby agree that all disputes between you and us (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with us, including without limitation disputes related to this Agreement, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, may, in our discretion, be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. You agree that you shall not participate in any class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this Agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the US Federal Arbitration Act, to the extent permissible. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this Agreement. &nbsp;You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor we can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:</span></p>
